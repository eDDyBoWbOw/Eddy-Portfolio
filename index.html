                    Hey my name is, Edward T Caldwell

                    I'm from Long beach, CA but grow up in multiple different states (NYC,GA,CA) I gained a life-skill
                    of
                    being diversed and well rounded to people, so with that being said i'm kinda of a people person.
                    "haha"


                    I've been a bartender for about 10 years (ish), At various casino jobs (Such as Morongo Casino,
                    Pechanga
                    Casino) While also doing bartend commercials for those companies.

                    I enjoy playing video games , watching tv shows and trying any i mean any type of food that lands on
                    my
                    plate.

                    My personality is funny cause i believe i'm a introvert but everyone who truly knows me say i'm
                    outgoing
                    life of the party and a pleasure to be around so guess they believe i'm a extrovert. (I don't see it
                    i
                    love
                    being at home)
